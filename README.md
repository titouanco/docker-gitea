[Gitea](https://gitea.io). Built by [Drone](https://drone.titouan.co/t/docker-gitea) and pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/eownis/gitea/).

## Usage

Extract from my `docker-compose.yml` file, adapt to your needs :

```yaml
...
  gitea:
    image: eownis/gitea:latest
    container_name: gitea
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "22:2222/tcp"
    volumes:
      - ./gitea:/data
    environment:
      - UID=1000
      - GID=1000
...
```

If you use a `docker-compose.yml` file you can pretty much copy paste the snippet, add gitea to your reverse proxy (the web interface is listening on port 3000)
