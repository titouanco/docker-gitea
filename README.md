## Usage

Extract from my `docker-compose.yml` file, adapt to your needs :

```yaml
...
  gitea:
    image: titouanco/gitea:latest
    container_name: gitea
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "22:2222/tcp"
    volumes:
      - ./gitea:/data
    environment:
      - UID=1000
      - GID=1000
...
```

If you use a `docker-compose.yml` file you can pretty much copy paste the snippet and add gitea to your reverse proxy (the web interface is listening on port 3000)
